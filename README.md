<h1>Fruits defect classification system</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Consumers often rely on a fruitâ€™s external appearance when deciding to buy it or not, so the food industry must make sure that their produce meets market quality standards. Accurately identifying the quality of fresh fruits and vegetables has become crucial. This project focuses on developing a fruits defects classification system using computer vision and deep learning. The proposed system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish between fresh and rotten apples, oranges, and bananas.
